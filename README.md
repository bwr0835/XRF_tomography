# XRF_tomography

The main function for reconstruction is in `XRF_tomography.py`.

Before running a reconstruction, please change the parameters in `P_cal.py` and execute the file to calculate the intersecting between the emitted fluorescence signal path and the object.  

You can start with modifying the parameters `JXRFT_recon_simu.py` or `JXRFT_recon_cabead.py` for simulated and experimental data and execute the file for testing the reconstruction.

cabead datasets can be downloaded [here](https://nuwildcat.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/WNB-JacobsenPhysicsLab/Shared%20Documents/Panpan_Huang/XRF_tomography/XRF_tomography_data?csf=1&web=1&e=uAXReg):

# XRF_tomography

The main function for reconstruction is in `XRF_tomography.py`.
Before running a reconstruction, please change the parameters in `P_cal.py` and execute the file to calculate the intersecting between the emitted fluorescence signal path and the object.  
You can start with modifying the parameters `JXRFT_recon_simu.py` or `JXRFT_recon_cabead.py` for simulated and experimental data and execute the file for testing the reconstruction.
